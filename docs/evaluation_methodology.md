# Evaluation Methodology

## Evaluation Measures

The project will assess each algorithm using the following metrics:

1. **Time Complexity**: Number of nodes expanded during search
2. **Space Complexity**: Maximum number of nodes stored in memory
3. **Solution Optimality**: Whether the shortest path is found
4. **Path Cost**: Number of steps in the solution path

## Expected Outcomes

- Successful implementation of six search algorithms
- Comparative analysis highlighting differences in efficiency, memory usage, and solution quality
- Clear visualization of exploration patterns for each algorithm
- Insights into which algorithms are better suited for different types of grid-based pathfinding problems
